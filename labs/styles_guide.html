      <!--Overall Formatting-->
      <div class="overall">
          <h2>Overall Formatting</h2>
          <p>The <b>font-family</b> that I used for the website is Open Sans and then I have Helvetica, serif, and sans-serif as my fall back fonts. I used the &commat;font-face selector to get the Open Sans font from google. </p>
          <p>The <b> font color</b> that I used was black for the &lt;p&gt; is black. For the heading tags, I used a color that looks almost grey with a hex code of #333333. For the list headers I used light purple color and dark beige for the list background. I also made sure to capitalize all of the list headings as well.  </p>
      </div>

      <!--Header Section-->
      <div class="header">
          <h2>Header Section</h2>
          <p>In the<b>&lt;header&gt;</b> section, I started by adding an image of myself and placed it in the middle of the page. I also gave that image a solid 2 pixels border with a hex color code of #474745. Then I turned the border of the image into a circle by changing the border-radius, width, and height of the image.</p>

          <p>In the same header section I added a <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b> section, which contains a list of links that a user can use to navigate to specific sections of tha webpage. I gave these navigation links a font-family of Helvetica with serif and sans-serif as the backup fonts. The text color that i used was light blue (#079AC1) for normal color, and pink-ish (#AB0F43) color for when a user hovers over them. I made the font-size a little bit bigger (20px).</p>

          <p>The navigation links are displayed inline with a background color of #AB0F43, border-radius of 10 pixels, aligned the text in the center, font-weight of 500, and left padding by 10 pixels.</p>
      </div>

      <!--Content Section-->
      <div class="content">
        <h2>Content Section</h2>
          <p>For the <b>content</b> section or the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b>, I added a background image that i found online and added a margin of 10 pixels to the left and right side of the content. I did so to squeeze the content towards the middle of the screen because I didn't like how much the content was so stretched out on the screen.</p>
      </div>

      <!--Navigation Links or links in general-->
      <div class="navigation">
          <h2>Navigation Links</h2>
          <p>For site <b>navigation links</b> I used the same font-family as the rest of the website, but I did change the link colors. For example, when the link hasn't been clicked on at all the color is light blue. When the link has been visited, the color changes to red. When you hover a mouse over the link, the color changes to pink. When the link is activated the color changes to green. When the link is in focus, the link color turns blue.</p>
      </div>

      <!--Footer Formatting-->
      <div class="footer">
          <h2>Site Footer</h2>
          <p>For the site <b>footer</b>, I used Helvetica font-family with serif and sans-serif as the backup fonts. I also gave the footer a horizontal line that separates it from the rest of the page, a background of #474745, and a white font so that way the text doesn't blend in with the background.</p>
